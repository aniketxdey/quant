# Introduction to C++ for Financial Engineers: An Object-Oriented Approach
## Chapter 2: The Mechnaics of C++ - from Source Code to a Running Program
- Define syntax to create and run simple programs, and understand how they are run

## 1.2 Short Background
- C++ = C "with classes"
- Object-oriented projects and classes, but is multi-paradigm in nature

## 1.3 Multi-Paradigm Analysis
### Object-Oriented Paradigm
- Based on the concept off a class which has origins in philosophy, logic, and psychology
- Theory of concepts has been an important influence on the development of the object paradigm
- Classes consist of data and functions, and we create objects or so-called instances of the class by initializing the data in the class
### Generic Programming
- Paradigm that is a competitor of the object-oriented paradigm
- Not focused on hard-wired data types - design software with generic underlying types, and instantiate or clone the entity by replacing types later on
### Procedural, modular, and functional programming
- Fortran is useful for formula transformation in math/engineering apps

## 1.5 Software Quality
Six Characteristics:
1. Functionality - functionality of a system to satisfy user needs - includes accuracy, sutiability, interoperability, compliance, security
2. Reliability - maintaining a given level of performance over time - includes maturity, fault tolerance, recoverability
3. Usability - effort needed to use an application or system - includes understandability, learnability, and operability
4. Efficiency - Kevel of performance and amount of resources needed to reach performance 
5. Maintainability - effort needed to make modifications
6. Portability - ability to be transferred from one environment to another
